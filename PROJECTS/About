Build a Java console application that allows teachers or administrators to manage student report cards. The system supports adding student records, entering subject-wise scores, calculating averages and grades, and displaying report cards. It includes search functionality  name or ID, data persistence using file I/O, and robust error handling. 

Description

How to Approach
Create a Student Report Card Management System as a Java console application. The program allows users (teachers or administrators) to manage student records, add subject-wise marks, compute grades, and generate formatted report cards. It demonstrates core Java concepts like OOP, file I/O, data structures, and exception handling.
Functional Requirements

1. Input:
Prompt the user to add a new student with a unique ID, name, and age.
Allow the user to enter marks for multiple subjects for each student.
Provide options to search students by ID or name.

2. Output:
Display all student records.
Show a formatted report card for a selected student, including:
Student details
List of subjects and corresponding marks
Total, average, and grade (A/B/C/D/F based on average score)

3. Grade Calculation:
A (90-100)
B (80-89)
C (70-79)
D (60-69)
F (<60)

4. Data Persistence:
Save all student records to a text file.
Load saved data automatically on program startup.
Append new entries without overwriting existing data.

5. Error Handling:
Validate user inputs (e.g., marks between 0-100, positive age values).
Handle invalid input and file I/O exceptions using try-catch blocks.

6. Program Flow:
Show a main menu with options to:
Add a new student
Enter marks
View report cards
Search for students
Exit
Loop the menu until the user chooses to exit.

7. Dependencies:
Use Java core libraries (java.util, java.io).
Use ArrayList and arrays for managing student data in memory.
Java 8 features like lambda expressions or streams (optional, if applicable).
